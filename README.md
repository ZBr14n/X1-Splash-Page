# X1-Splash-Page
I was assigned to rebuild this website from scratch, originally in WordPress, using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP. After many failed attempts on domain forwarding from AWS hosted web server
to a Wordpress hosted platform, the website has been rebuilt from scratch to meet project deadline. The client was very happy that it is no longer crashing and using all memory/CPU on the server.

#### To practice DevOps, I have dockerized the php website with Apache and exposed port 80. Afterwards, I uploaded the image to Azure Container Registry and then used Container Instance to deploy the image. 



### In progress: create yaml file Ingress controller/Services and deploy with Kubernetes
